# Quiz-App
This application is designed using C++. 

In this application user can appear for a quiz, one question at a time. Each question will have 4 answers, user has to choose the correct one. When user submits the answer, the program will evaluate it against stored answer for the specific questions. All the questions will be evaluated in the similar manner and marks will be assigned to the correctly chosen answers. At the end program will display the marks that the user has secured in the quiz.

## STEPS TO BE DONE BEFORE DESIGNING THE "Main Screen"

Before designing the Main Screen , we need to do the following:
1. Add support of conio2.h in the project.
2. Create a header file called "quiz.h" which contains class declarations and member function declarations
3. Create a source code file called "quiz.cpp" which contains definitions of the member functions declared in the file "quiz.h". 

## ADDING "conio2.h" SUPPORT
1. Create the project "QUIZ APPLICATION" in CODEBLOCKS.
2. Download the file conio21.zip from the url https://sourceforge.net/projects/conio/.
3. Unzip the file and copy 2 files "conio.c" and "conio2.h" from it into your project folder.
4. Now we can call all BORLAND style functions like clrscr(),getch(), textcolor(),gotoxy() etc in the project.
